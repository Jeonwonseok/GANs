# Codes
Some useful codes related to Generative Adversarial Networks by brilliant researchers.

Some of them created and edited by me.

## [GAN_intro](https://github.com/Jeonwonseok/GANs/tree/master/Codes/GAN_intro)
- 1D Gaussian Distribution approximation

## [GANs MNIST](https://github.com/Jeonwonseok/GANs/tree/master/Codes/GANs_MNIST)
- GANs generates the numbers, learning from MNIST

## [DCGAN MNIST](https://github.com/Jeonwonseok/GANs/tree/master/Codes/DCGAN_MNIST)
- DCGAN learns how to generate the numbers with conditioning vector, from MNIST
