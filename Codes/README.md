# Codes
Some useful codes related to Generative Adversarial Networks by brilliant researchers.

Some of them created and edited by me.

## [GAN_intro](https://github.com/Jeonwonseok/GANs/tree/master/Codes/GAN_intro)
- 1D Gaussian Distribution approximation
- Reference: AYLIEN's posting http://blog.aylien.com/introduction-generative-adversarial-networks-code-tensorflow/

## [GANs MNIST](https://github.com/Jeonwonseok/GANs/tree/master/Codes/GANs_MNIST)
- GANs generates the numbers, learning from MNIST
